# VanillaCanvasAnimation
A cool canvas animation with vanilla ES6. I tried to use lots of functional programming.

-----

## Running
Open up `index.html` in an ES6 browser. I made this testing with chrome. If you can't open it directly, try running a local server in this directory and connecting to it with your browser.

## Testing
Open up the `SpecRunner.html` in your ES6 browser.
